1- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if i work in a project with another programmers or if i need a backup for my projects

2- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because if i change the same file that another one change it will be a conflict
and this not good for coding so this is helpful because  i pull when I'm ready.

3- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: is copy of the Git project inside GitHub
it's like the clone but it work inside GitHub
Clone: is making copy from local or remote repository
Branch: is a part of the repository
